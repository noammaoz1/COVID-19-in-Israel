# Insights – COVID-19 in Israel

### 1. Infection Waves
- Israel experienced several distinct waves of infection, with major peaks in late 2020, early 2021, and early 2022.  
- The largest wave occurred in early 2022, with approximately **1.4 million new cases** at its peak.  
- After 2022, infection levels gradually declined, approaching near zero by 2023-2024.

### 2. Death Rates
- Despite high infection rates, Israel maintained a **relatively low death rate (0.26%)** compared to countries such as Peru, Bulgaria, and Hungary (all > 0.5%).  
- While infections surged, mortality increased more moderately, with distinct peaks in late 2020, early 2021 (the highest, with 1,523 new deaths), and in early 2022. After 2022, death cases declined, approaching near zero by 2023-2024.
- This suggests that Israel’s healthcare response and rapid access to vaccines significantly reduced mortality.  

### 3. Vaccinations
- Israel’s vaccination campaign in early 2021 was among the fastest.  
- As vaccination rates climbed, the death rate trend declined.  
- Vaccination coverage stabilized at around **71% of the population**.

### 4. Testing & Positivity
- Testing volume peaked in 2021-2022, with more than **14 million tests per quarter** at the height of the campaign.  
- After early 2022, both the number of tests and the positivity rate declined sharply, nearing zero by 2023.  
- This reflects both the reduction in infections and a strategic shift away from mass testing once the pandemic was under control.

### 5. Global Comparison
- Israel’s infection rate (~51% of the total population) was relatively high compared to many countries.
  Nevertheless, the **death rate remained significantly lower**.
